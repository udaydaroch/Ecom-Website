Data Retrieval:
When dealing with a large dataset, such as a list of search results or items in a database, retrieving all the data at once can be inefficient and slow.
Pagination involves fetching only a subset of the data (a "page") at a time.

Displaying Data:
The retrieved data is then displayed on the webpage, usually in a list or grid format.
Each page contains a specific number of items (e.g., 10, 20, or 50 items per page), making it more manageable for users to browse.

Navigation Controls:
Pagination typically includes navigation controls to move between pages. Common controls include:
Previous and Next buttons
Page numbers
First and Last page links

Backend Implementation:
On the server side, the backend needs to support pagination. This involves accepting parameters (such as page number and items per page) and returning the relevant subset of data.
The server often provides metadata, like the total number of pages, to assist in creating the pagination controls on the client side.

Client-Side Interaction:
Users interact with the pagination controls to navigate through the different pages.
When a new page is requested, the client sends a request to the server for the corresponding data.

Improved User Experience:
Pagination improves the user experience by avoiding information overload and speeding up the loading time of web pages.
Users can focus on a specific portion of the dataset and navigate to other sections when needed.

SEO Considerations:
For search engine optimization (SEO), it's essential to ensure that search engines can crawl and index all the pages of your paginated content. Proper implementation involves using rel="prev" and rel="next" link tags in the HTML head to indicate the relationship between consecutive pages.
Infinite Scroll vs. 

Traditional Pagination:
In addition to traditional pagination, some websites use infinite scroll, where new content loads automatically as the user scrolls down. Both approaches have their advantages and drawbacks, and the choice depends on the nature of the content and user preferences.
